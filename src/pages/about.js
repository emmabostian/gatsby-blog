          I never wanted to become a Software Engineer. This can be attributed to
          the fact that my father is a Software Engineer & Architect and my mother
          is a Designer. But I found my passion for engineering during college.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2015 I graduated from Siena College in Albany, New York with a B.S. in
          Computer Science. I loved my four years in college. I studied abroad at
          City University in London my Junior year. I took a service trip to Haiti
          my Senior year. And I was manager, and trumpet player, for the Pep Band.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Summer between my Junior and Senior years I completed an internship at
          IBM in Poughkeepsie. I worked on WebSphere Application Server and learned
          how to automate the installation of WAS on z/OS using Python. I even
          managed to squeeze in a win for the IBM intern video competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from college I flew down to Austin, Texas to begin my
          career at IBM. During the next two years I would help build the UI for the
          IBM Spectrum Control and Storage Insights offerings. I worked primarily
          with JavaScript, Dojo, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Java when I would
          occasionally contribute to the test automation efforts. It was also during
          this time that I became the Accessibility Lead where I was responsible for
          ensuring W3C Accessibility Compliance for both products.

          In October of 2017, I was approached by the VP of IBM Systems and
          Transformation. He wanted me to join their design team and help prototype
          in code. I got to work on many incredible projects during this time. I
          build the Linux on Power Developer Portal using WordPress. I helped
          transform the future of Support with the Support Transformation team. But
          my biggest accomplishment was IBM Quantum.
        </p>
        <p>
          I single-handedly build the IBM Q Network website using Vue.js. This was a
          major accomplishment for me, as I had never used Vue for proprietary code
          until this point. The website was a huge success.
        </p>

          It was during my time at IBM that I met my current husband. He was a
          developer on the same project. The only catch? He lived in Germany.
        </p>
        <img src={date2018} alt="2018" />
        <p>
          In February of 2018, I left IBM, sold everything I owned, and flew my two
          cats and myself out to Germany. I had secured a job with LogMeIn prior to
          making the move, and it wasn’t an easy transition, but it was so worth the
          risk. Today I work on GoToMeeting and get to develop using React, Redux,
          Typescript and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy blogging, reading, and traveling. I’ve read 70
          books thus far in 2018 and traveled to 10 countries this year alone. I’m
          looking forward to what the future has to offer.
